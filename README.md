# Introduction to Open Policy Agent

In the talk, I will show how Open Policy Agent (OPA) and policy-as-a-code address a wide range of problems from implementing policies, and checks, to application customization and configuration. Policy-as-a-code has benefits, but also limitations that I am going to cover as well.
